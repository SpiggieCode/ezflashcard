<h4>About EzFlashcard</h4>
            EzFlashcard is a user-friendly, open-source tool designed to dynamically create flashcards using key=value parameters in the URL. 
            <br>Essentially, it functions like a REST API without a backend. The content is passed through the URL, and the application runs in the end user's browser.
            <br><br>I originally developed this to enable a custom language learning GPT to create flashcards, but this is just one of its many potential use cases.

<br><br>Known issues:
<br>1. Using the character & in a question or answer will break the cards, avoid using this for now
<br>2. I need to fix toggle alignment on small screens
<br>3. Changing a setting resets cards
