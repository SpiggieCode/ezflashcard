<h4>About EzFlashcard</h4>
            EzFlashcard is a user-friendly, open-source tool designed to dynamically create flashcards using key=value parameters in the URL. 
            <br>Essentially, it functions like a REST API without a backend. The content is passed through the URL, and the application runs in the end user's browser.
            <br><br>I originally developed this to enable a custom language learning GPT to create flashcards, but this is just one of its many potential use cases.
